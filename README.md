# Agentic-Hedgefund-Chatbot
This project brings together multiple components—language models, PDF parsing, Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP), and a TD3 reinforcement-learning agent—to demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for answering investment-related questions, constructing a risk-weighted portfolio, and training a trading agent, all via a Streamlit app.
